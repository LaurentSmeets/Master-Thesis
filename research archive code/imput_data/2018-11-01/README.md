These files can be considered the raw imput files.

The *devices.csv* file stores information on the device that was used. The *users.csv* file stores information on the respondent and can be used to link both information on the device and registry information of the respondent (saved in the **external_imput_data\user_info**  folder). The *tracks.csv* file stores information on the trips that were recorded (start time and end time). The *transportation_modes.csv* file stores information on the transport modes belonging to different trips. Finally, *position_entries.csv* contains the raw location data.
