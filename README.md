# Master Thesis
Welcome to the Github repository of my thesis project. In the folder **research archive code**, you will find all the code needed to replicate my thesis (If you would collect sufficient data). Exact reproducibility is, unfortunately, not possible since this thesis is written within Statistics Netherlands (CBS), an organization with strict data protection rules. This means that raw data could not be exported.  However, this repository does lay out the necessary files, code, analysis and file formats. It also outlays the folder structure and the different dependencies. The main file with all the code can be found in the subfolder **research archive code/code**. The folder **documents** hosts the Tex version of my manuscript.
